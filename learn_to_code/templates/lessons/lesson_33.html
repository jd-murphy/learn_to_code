<h1>Lesson 33</h1>
<h2>So sensitive!</h2>

<p>Okay coder, we've seen how
     to take input from our user and give it to python. The problem is, we were checking for the specific string <b>"programmer"</b> 
     and if the user typed in <b>"Programmer"</b> or <b>"PROGRAMMER"</b> we wouldn't get the right result... Of course, python has 
     a way to solve this problem! Python is <b>case sensitive</b>, that means that <b>"true"</b> is different than <b>"True"</b> is different than <b>"TRUE"</b>.
     So we have to make sure python can handle any capitalization of a word and treat it as the same word. 
     The trick is to use <b>.upper()</b> or <b>.lower()</b>! <b>.upper()</b> and <b>.lower()</b> are <b>methods</b> 
     we can use to change <b>strings</b> in python. Check it out! Type in a word in all lowercase letters and run your code.
</p>
<div class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5">
    <code>
        data = input("What is the secret word? ")<br>
        print(f"The secret is -> {data.upper()}")
    </code>
</div>
<p><b>.lower()</b> works just the same. Try typing in your name in proper 
    capitalization like this: <em>Firstname Lastname</em>. Run the code to see how python uses <b>.lower()</b>.</p> 
<div class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5">
    <code>
        name = input("Enter your name: ")<br>
        print(f"Transformed to lowercase -> {name.lower()}")
    </code>
</div>
