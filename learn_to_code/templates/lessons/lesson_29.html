<h1>Lesson 29</h1>
<h2>print() it again!</h2>

<p>Okay coder, we've seen how
    <b>print()</b> by separating <b>arguments</b> with a comma, 
    but there are more ways to <b>print()</b> out our information.
    Another option is using <b>.format()</b>
</p>
<div class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5">
    <code>
        result = 5 * 16<br>
        print("The answer is {}".format(result))<br>
        <br>
        name = "Sarah"<br>
        age = 23<br>
        print("{name} is {age} years old".format(name=name, age=age))<br>
    </code>
</div>
<p>You can pass a single <b>argument</b> to <b>.format()</b> or you can pass more than one! 
    You can see from the example above that if we only use one argument we use empty 
    curly braces <b>{}</b> in our string. If you want to pass more than one <b>arguments</b> 
    you can pass them as <b>keywords arguments</b>as in the second example. 
    Make sure to name the arguments in the curly braces in your string! Look carefully at the examples to see the difference.</p>
