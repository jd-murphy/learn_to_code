<h1>Lesson 30</h1>
<h2>Another format!</h2>

<p>Okay coder, we've seen how
     to <b>.format()</b> a string and pass in variables. 
     But in the newest version of python that we are using (Python 3) there is an even easier way!
     Let's use <b>f-string</b> to put our data into a string!
     <b>f-string</b>s use a different syntax, and I think you'll get comfortable with it quickly!
     Normally we wrap our strings in quotes like this <b>"Hey!"</b> or this <b>'Howdy!'</b> and either way is fine. 
     With <b>f-string</b>s we are going to prefix our string with the letter <b>f</b> like this: <b>f"Hey there!"</b>
     Then, to put data in our <b>f-string</b>, we use curly braces <b>{}</b> with the variable inside as we have before. <b>f"Hey there {name}!"</b>
</p>
<div class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5">
    <code>
        name = "Jeffrey"<br>
        print(f"Welcome, {name}!")<br>
        <br>
        balance = 237.94<br>
        print(f"Welcome, {name}. Your balance is ${balance}")<br>        
    </code>
</div>
<p>There are lots of ways to format strings in python, 
    and you can use whichever one you want. I prefer <b>f-strings</b> with Python 3. 
    With earlier versions of Python you might have to use another method to format, as shown in previous lessons.</p>
