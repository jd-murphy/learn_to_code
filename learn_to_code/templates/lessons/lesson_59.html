<h1>Lesson 59</h1>
<h2>By threes!</h2>

<p>Okay coder, we've seen quite a bit of new stuff. This is a good time to talk about solving problems in code.
    There is <em>ALWAYS</em> more than one way to solve a programming problem. 
    Let's look at different ways to make a <b>list</b> counting by <b>3</b>s from <b>1</b> to <b>100</b> 
    using everything we've learned. To add an item to the end of a <b>list</b> we use <b>.append()</b> like this
</p>
<div class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5">
    <code>
        threes = []<br>
        for i in range(1, 100):<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;if i % 3 == 0: <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threes.append(i) <br>
        print(threes)
    </code>
</div>
<p>Or we could do it this way</p> 
<div class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5">
    <code>
        threes = []<br>
        for i in range(3, 100, 3):<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;threes.append(i) <br>
        print(threes)
    </code>
</div>
