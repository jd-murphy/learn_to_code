<h1>Lesson 32</h1>
<h2>Data in, data out</h2>

<p>Okay coder, we've seen how
     to get <b>input</b> from our user with the <b>input()</b> function. 
     Let's use it again to gather more data to work with.
</p>
<div class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5">
    <code class="hide-code">
        name = input("What is your name? ")<br>
        age = input("How old are you? ")<br>
        occupation = input("What is your job? ")<br>

        print(f"Your name is {name}, and you are {age}.")<br>
        if occupation == "programmer":<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;print("Programmer? Awesome! Excellent choice!") <br>
        else:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;print(f"So you're a {occupation}. Interesting.") <br>
    </code>
</div>
<p>Type the code in the <b>editor</b> and run your code. Python will be waiting for you to provide <b>input</b> 
by typing your answer in the <b>terminal</b>. Push <b>enter</b> after each answer so python can process your <b>input</b>! 
Run your code a few times and give different <b>input</b> to see how python responds. Note: Right now, our python code will 
only notice "programmer" if it is spelled with the same capitalization. 
We will soon learn how to fix that.</p>
