<h1>Lesson 25</h1>
<h2>If this and that</h2>

<p>Okay coder, we've seen how
    to use an <b>if</b> statement and even how to use <b>else</b>. 
    But we can add another tool to make this a more powerful way to make decisions.
    Python has two keywords we can use to make <b>if</b> and <b>else</b> more useful. 
    Introducing <b>and</b> and <b>or</b>! The way they work is pretty straightforward.
    You can use <b>and</b> to tell python to check if both the left <b>and</b> right side are 
    <b>True</b>, and you can use <b>or</b> to ask python to tell us if the left 
    <b>or</b> the right side (or both sides!) are <b>True</b>.

</p>
<div class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5">
    <code id="copy-code">
        verified = True<br>
        logged_in = True<br>
        if verified and logged_in:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;print("You can access your account info.") <br>
        else:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;print("You must be logged in to access this content.") <br>
    </code>
</div>
<p>Try changing <b>logged_in</b> to <b>False</b> and see what the <b>if</b> statement does.
    Don't forget your colon <b>:</b> at the end of the <b>if</b> and the <b>else</b> as well as the <b>tab</b> on the next lines!
    Combining <b>and</b> with <b>if</b> means python will execute the code 
    in the body of the <b>if</b> statement <em>only if both sides are <b>True</b>.</em>
We'll learn how to use <b>or</b> in the next lesson.</p>
