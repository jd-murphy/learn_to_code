<h1>Lesson 39</h1>
<h2>A second look</h2>

<p>Okay coder, let's look at the code from the last lesson. That was a lot of new stuff.
</p>
<div class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5">
    <code id="copy-code">
        total = 0.0<br>
        price = input("Enter the price of the item: ")<br>
        while price:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;total += float(price) <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;price = input("Enter the price of the next item: ") <br>
        print(f"Your total is ${total}")
    </code>
</div>
<p>The first line <b>declares</b> and <b>initializes</b> a variable called <b>total</b> to keep track of the total price. 
    The next line starts getting user <b>input</b>, which we're familiar with. We store the <b>input</b> into the variable <b>price</b>.
    On the next line we start our <b>while loop</b>. <b>Loops</b> repeat code. 
    The <b>while loop</b> runs the code inside, <em><b>while</b></em> the <b>condition</b> is <b>True</b>. 
    In this example the <b>condition</b> is the variable <b>price</b>. That means as long as 
    <b>price</b> contains any information at all, it will be considered <b>True</b>, and the <b>loop</b> will run again. 
    Inside our <b>loop</b> we have two lines of code. The first line converts the <b>input</b> from a <b>str</b> to a <b>float</b>, 
     and adds it to the variable <b>total</b>. This means the value of <b>total</b> is increased by the amount of <b>price</b>. We use <b>float()</b> 
     to convert the input to a <b>float</b>, which is a number <b>data type</b> for working with decimals. 
     Then we ask the user for the next price.
    Everytime through the <b>loop</b>, the variable <b>price</b> is checked. If it contains something, 
    it runs the <b>loop</b> again. When the user stops entering prices and just presses enter, the 
    variable <b>price</b> won't have anything in it, it is empty. Python treats an empty variable 
    as <b>False</b> so the <b>loop</b> stops immediately. Then the code <em>after</em> the <b>loop</b> runs.
