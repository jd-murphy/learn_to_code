<h1>Lesson 20</h1>
<h2>Comparing variables</h2>

<p>Okay coder, we've seen how
    do a lot of comparison tests but we have only 
    stored the comparison result in a variable.
    We can do much cooler things. Check this out. 
    Say we are coding a video game. We might give the 
    player 3 lives before they have to restart a level.
    We can set a variable to keep track of how many lives they have left.
</p>
<div class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5">
    <code class="hide-code">
        lives_left = 3<br>
        print(lives_left)<br>
        lives_left -= 1<br>
        print(lives_left > 0)<br>
        lives_left -= 1<br>
        print(lives_left > 0)<br>
        lives_left -= 1<br>
        print(lives_left > 0)

    </code>
</div>
<p>You can see that every time we take away a life, we 
    check to see if the player has enough lives left to continue playing. 
    As long as <b>lives_left</b> is greater than 0, we let the player continue.</p>
