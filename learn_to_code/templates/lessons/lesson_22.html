<h1>Lesson 22</h1>
<h2>Decisions, decisions...</h2>

<p>Okay coder, we've got some awesome tools to work with. Now we need to learn 
    how to make a smart computer program. And by smart, I mean make decisions. That's right. 
    Your code can make decisions. Let's see how.
    The questions we have been asking python up until now are mostly <b>is</b> questions. 
    Is 5 greater than <b>result</b>? Is <b>current_speed</b> less than <b>speed_limit</b>?
    These kinds of quesitions are very important in coding and we are going to keep using them.
    But let's add the big <b>if</b> into the mix. In python we can ask <b>if</b> something is <b>True</b>.
    Check it out! Let's check back with our video game.
</p>
<div class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5">
    <code id="copy-code">
        lives_left = 3<br>
        if lives_left > 0:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;print("You have enough life. Keep playing!")</span>
    </code>
</div>
<p>You need to make sure you press the <b>tab</b> key on the line after your <b>if</b> statement. 
    Python uses whitespace like tabs to figure out what you are trying to ask it to do.</p>
<p>There are some new things like the colon <b>:</b> at the end of the <b>if</b> statement line, and the whitespace
    on the line below the <b>if</b>. But all in all, it's really just a simple question. 
    And python is really happy to give us an answer!</p>
