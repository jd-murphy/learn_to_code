<h1>Lesson 7</h1>
<h2>Divide the work load!</h2>

<p>Okay coder, now it's time to divide! We need to be 
    a careful here, because division and Python both have special rules.
    We cannot divide a number by zero <b>0</b>, it's illegal in math and Python! 
    But let's try anyways and see what Python does! Use this slash <b>/</b> to 
    make Python divide numbers. Try 
</p>
<div class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5">
    <code>print(4/0)</code>
</div>
<p>ðŸ˜§ Uh oh! our first coding problem!</p> 
<div class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5">
    <code>
        Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
        File "python", line 2, in &#60;module&#62; <br>
        ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
    </code>
</div>
<p>That's an <b>Error</b>! It tells us Python can't divide by zero. So try something legal,
    like <b>4 divided by 2</b> and then <b>10 divided by 3</b>. 
    As long as we don't divide by 0, we should be fine.
