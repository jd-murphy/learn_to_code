<h1>Lesson 12</h1>
<h2>four = 2 + 2</h2>

<p>Okay coder, we've seen how
    to do math in variables, but we need to have a talk 
    about something that might get confusing. How do we 
    decide what to name our variables? We have a lot of options. 
    We can use letters and numbers and even the underscore <b>_</b>&nbsp;!<br>
    We also need to avoid special words that python depends on. 
    They are called <b>keywords</b> and we will talk about them more later. 
    But let's talk about confusing names. For example, when we are 
    doing math we might want to name our variable <b>answer</b>
    or <b>result</b>... But when we are asking someone's name it 
    makes more sense to call our variable <b>name</b>, right?
</p>
<div class="mt-3 mb-3 ml-5">
    <code>
        answer = 5 + 416 / 7<br>
        print(answer)<br>
        name = "Thomas"<br>
        print(name)<br>
    </code>
</div>
<p>We can even use a single letter like <b>x</b>, or <b>i</b>. But it's usually 
    a really good idea to make sure the name of the variable <em>makes sense</em>. 
    We should avoid using confusing variable names, as we'll see in the next lesson.</p>
